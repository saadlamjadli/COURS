Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better. The official Algolia CLI is a good choice.

You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order.

peut également permettre le suivi sous traitement (au moins pour la maladie de Wegener) Comme pour tous les autoanticorps, l’examen de première intention est IFI La deuxième étape obligatoire est la caractérisation de la cible reconnue par un test en phase solide : Elisa, immunodot, immuno-empreinte un test fluorométrique ou multiplexe Ces autoanticorps auraient un rôle direct dans la pathogénie

granules primaires des PNN, avec la cathepsine G, l’élastase et l’azurocidine Elle est la cible antigénique préférentielle des ANCA dans la granulomatose de Wegener et est, par ailleurs, surexprimée dans certaines leucémies myéloïdes aiguës ou chroniques La PR3 est une protéine monocaténaire de 228 acides aminés, cationique, amphophile et microbicide La PR3 détruit les bactéries dans les phagosomes La forme active est stockée, complexée à des protéoglycans, dans les granules primaires PR3 est aussi présente dans les granules secondaires et les granules de type gélatinase PR3 à la capacité cliver l’IL-8 et le C1-inhibiteur, et à inhiber NADPH oxydase, ce qui concourt à l’entretien des manifestations inflammatoires Elle peut se lier aux cellules endothéliales et entraîner leur apoptose, expliquant pour partie les lésions vasculaires des vascularites Normalement, la PR3 est soumise, dans la circulation, à une inhibition par des membres de la famille des serpines au premier : l’alpha-1-antitrypsine, puis l’alpha-2-macroglobuline Association parfois observée de déficit en l’alpha-1-antitrypsine aux vascularites b Myélopéroxydase La MPO contenue dans les granules primaires, est un oxydant puissant MPO est responsable de la couleur verte du pus La MPO permet la production d’acide hypochloreux agent bactériolytique : H2O2 + Cl− + H3O+ → HOCl + 2H2O Les PNN utilisées comme substrat en IFI, permettent d’identifier la spécificité anti-MPO des ANCA par simple comparaison avec les résultats obtenus sur PNN de sujets sains Les anticorps anti-MPO sont dirigés contre des épitopes conformationnels et n’interfèrent pas avec l’activité enzymatique de la molécule Les anticorps anti-MPO sont retrouvés dans 64 % des GNEC pauci imunes, 58 % des micropolyangéites et 24 % des maladies de Wegener c Autres spécificités ou antigènes mineurs Il existe des cibles antigéniques mineurs ne reconnaissant ni la PR3, ni la MPO dans différentes situations cliniques : maladies inflammatoires intestinales, collagénoses Dans ces différentes situations, les ANCA ne seraient que les simples marqueurs d’une activation chronique des PNN Ces ANCA, qui donnent souvent une fluorescence atypique, ont été initialement appelés x-ANCA « Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein » (BPI) Les BPI-ANCA sont retrouvés dans les mucoviscidoses infectées par du Pseudomonas et dans les maladies inflammatoires intestinales Les anticorps anti-BPI ont un aspect de cANCA La moitié des anticorps anti-BPI sont négatifs en IFI, uniquement mis en évidence par des tests en phase solide Azurocidine C’est le deuxième antibiotique dirigé contre les bactéries à Gram négatif après la BPI Ils sont principalement retrouvés en association avec d’autres spécificités (MPO, lactoferrine) et surtout dans les vascularites induites par l’hydralazine Élastase et cathepsine G Ce sont, avec la PR3, les deux autres protéases à sérine des granules primaires Lactoferrine Les anticorps anti lactoferrine ont été retrouvés dans de rares cas de connectivites et dans les vascularites iatrogènes (hydralazine) Défensines Anticorps anti défensine dans 100 % des cas de sowda (« noir » en arabe, en raison de la couleur de la peau), forme particulière d’infection par un parasite, Onchocerca volvulus H-lamp-2 Retrouvée dans les PNN à la membrane des granules On la retrouve

exprime CD2 qui lui permet d’adhérer aux cellules endothéliales via LFA3 Elle possède un phénotype proche des cellules NK cytotoxiques ****lésions tissulaires des vascularites Plusieurs explications possibles sont avancées pour expliquer cette activation persistante : Le portage nasal chronique de Staphylococcus aureus Polymorphismes génétiques Défaut de la fonction suppressive des lymphocytes T régulateurs Une prédominance Th1 dans les formes localisées de maladie de Wegener, à opposer à la prédominance Th2 dans les formes généralisées (IL-4 et CCR3) a.2 Rôle des cellules endothéliales Les cellules endothéliales ont de nombreuses fonctions : Contrôle du tonus vasomoteur Régulation du trafic des éléments figurés du sang Régulation de la coagulation Régulation de la réponse immunitaire Leur phénotype varie selon leur état d’activation et leur localisation tissulaire En effet les interactions entre polynucléaires et cellules endothéliales sont perturbées par la présence des ANCA altérations de la paroi vasculaire L’interaction PNN/cellule endothéliale se fait en quatre temps : Attachement Roulement Arrêt Diapédèse a.3 Rôle du complément Différentes études portant soit sur des VAA retrouvent des dépôts de complément, principalement de C3, dans les biopsies rénales L’absence d’hypocomplémentémie n’est pas un argument contre une intervention du complément Le PNN est capable de synthétiser et de stocker dans ces granules du C3, du facteur B, mais aussi de la properdine, seule molécule de régulation positive de la C3 convertase alterne Toute activation des PNN par les ANCA peut donc conduire à la libération de ces composants et la mise en place d’une boucle d’auto amplification de la voie alterne b Facteurs environnementaux b.1 Infections Arguments pour une participation infectieuse dans la pathogénie des VAA : La variabilité saisonnière La précession fréquente des poussées de vascularites par des épisodes infectieux La fréquence d’un portage nasal chronique de Staphylococcus aureus chez les sujets souffrant de maladie de Wegener Mimétisme moléculaire comme facteur de rupture de tolérance Il s’agit le plus souvent d’infections chroniques, telles que des endocardites qui peuvent s’accompagner d’authentiques cANCA anti-PR3 qui disparaissent avec le traitement antibiotique adapté ANCA anti-BPI retrouvés chez les patients souffrant de mucoviscidose aux poumons colonisés par le bacille pyocyanique b.2 Silice Après l’oxygène (49 %), le silicium (Si) est le deuxième élément de l’écorce terrestre (26 %) Ce sont ces formes cristallines qui sont les plus toxiques Silice et vascularite à ANCA de spécificité MPO Silicose pulmonaire : Le macrophage alvéolaire qui phagocyte les particules de silice inhalées L’activation qui en résulte libère de nombreux médiateurs responsables de la survenue d’un granulome inflammatoire puis d’une fibrose cicatricielle b.3 Médicaments Le propylthio-uracile est le plus souvent cité (basedow) Pour la minocycline donnée au long cours pour le traitement de l’acné souvent associés à des anticorps antinucléaires Biothérapies anti-TNF Les ANCA des vascularites iatrogènes sont plus volontiers de type pANCA anti-MPO ou multispécifiques (l’élastase et/ou la lactoferrine), avec des titres élevés Le suivi des patients qui reçoivent ce type de médicaments doit être particulièrement orienté vers la détection précoce de signes cliniques de vascularites qui sont identiques à ceux des vascularites spontanées Le traitement repose sur l’arrêt de la prise médicamenteuse qui le plus souvent suffit au

du sérum ou du plasma La technique de référence pour la recherche des ANCA Le substrat est représenté par des PNN de sujets sains de groupe O fixés à l’éthanol (5 minutes à +4 ◦C avec de l’éthanol à 96-99 %) Cependant, compte tenu des difficultés de lecture, notamment liées à la présence d’AAN, d’autres fixateurs peuvent être utilisés, principalement le formol, ainsi que le méthanol La plupart des lames commerciales sont univoques pour le fixateur, mais certains proposent des assemblages associant des PNN fixés de différentes façons dans le même puits, ce qui diminue d’autant les séries à réaliser Sérum est à diluer au 1/40e (1/20 aussi) dans du PBS additionné d’albumine bovine (BSA) à 1 % pour diminuer le bruit de fond L’antisérum conjugué au fluorochrome est un anticorps antiimmunoglobulines humaines qui peut être soit polyvalent (anti-IgG, -IgA, -IgM), soit monospécifique anti-IgG Une contrecoloration par le bleu Evans est optionnelle Les deux incubations sont de 30 à 45 minutes, suivies de trois lavages de 5 minutes en PBS-BSA Les préparations sont montées entre lame et lamelle Chaque série doit inclure un témoin négatif et au moins deux, voire trois témoins positifs (cANCA, pANCA, voire aANCA) La lecture se fait au microscope à fluorescence équipé en épillumination, au grossissement 400, avec ou sans immersion. b Aspects en IFI des ANCA Éthanol Formol

autoanticorps sont susceptibles de rendre malaisée la lecture de la fluorescence : Les anticorps antiribosome sont susceptibles de donner une fluorescence cytoplasmique atypique des PNN, mais aussi des lymphocytes contaminants Les anticorps antimuscle lisse de spécificité antiactine donnent également un marquage de type cANCA Les anticorps anticentromère donnent sur PNN fixés par l’éthanol principalement dizaines de spots brillants accrochés à la membrane des lobes nucléaires Pour ces deux autoanticorps, l’aspect typique de la fluorescence sur cellules HEp-2, puis sur coupes d’organes

dépend de la nature de la préparation antigénique utilisée a ELISA Elisa direct : La pureté de la préparation antigénique conditionne la pert inence des résultats obtenus Pour exclure la possibilité de faux positifs colonne témoin de puits non recouverts d’antigène Elisa capture : fixer l’antigène (PR3 ou MPO), présent dans un extrait antigénique non purifié, par un anticorps monoclonal Le prérequis est que l’anticorps monoclonal utilisé ne soit pas dirigé contre un épitope immunodominant pour éviter une compétition avec les autoanticorps polyclonaux des patients, ce qui conduirait à des faux négatifs Pour exclure la possibilité d’une liaison non spécifique à l’anticorps de capture ou d’une interférence par la présence de facteurs rhumatoïdes, il est conseillé d’utiliser une plaque témoin avec un anticorps monoclonal témoin de même isotype mais sans activité anticorps dirigée contre un constituant de la préparation antigénique Pour les PR3-ANCA, la corrélation du titre avec celui des cANCA en IFI et avec l’activité clinique de la maladie de Wegener serait meilleure en utilisant un Elisa de capture, plutôt qu’un Elisa Direct Elisa de capture est préférable à l’Elisa

des ANCA et des anticorps anti membranes basales glomérulaires (MBG) va conditionner la mise en route d’un traitement immunosuppresseur d’autant plus efficace qu’il sera précoce Le test utilisé doit donc être sensible, tout en gardant à l’esprit l’existence de c/PR3-ANCA authentiques dans des endocardites bactériennes pouvant simuler un tableau de vascularite systémique La méconnaissance de cette situation pourrait avoir des conséquences thérapeutiques désastreuses si la seule présence de c/PR3-ANCA conduisait invariablement à la prescription d’un traitement immunosuppresseur c Multiplexage Ce système analytique repose sur trois éléments : des microbilles de polystyrène, des marqueurs fluorescents et un fluorimètre en flux Sur ces billes, des fonctions carboxyliques permettent de coupler de manière covalente des molécules d’intérêt porteuses de groupement amine Le fluorimètre est un cytométre en flux où des billes circulent à la place des cellules. Il est équipé de deux lasers de longueurs d’onde différentes dont les faisceaux frappent les billes qui défilent, alignées au centre du flux liquidien Le laser rouge permet d’identifier la couleur de la billes (donc l’autoantigène), le laser vert de mesurer la quantité de conjugué et donc la quantité d’autoanticorps fixés L’avantage de cette technologie est de pouvoir analyser simultanément un grand nombre de paramètres sur un même échantillon Sensibilité et une spécificité pour les vascularites associées aux ANCA (VAA) identiques à celles de l’Elisa et de l’immunodot, avec cependant un moins bon pouvoir prédictif des rechutes que l’Elisa de capture d Immunoempreintes Elle a permis de démembrer les différentes spécificités antigéniques en caractérisant leur poids moléculaire Exploitation commerciale est difficilement envisageable ","date":"2023-09-28","objectID":"/basic-markdown-syntax/:5:3","tags":["IMMUNOPATHOLOGIE"],"title":"Les vascularites à ANCA","uri":"/basic-markdown-syntax/"},{"categories":["IMMUNOPATHOLOGIE"],"content":"5 Intérêt pour le suivi La réponse polyclonale de la phase active initiale est dirigée contre l’ensemble des épitopes de la PR3 et de la MPO Sous l’effet du traitement immunosuppresseur, la réponse polyclonale, si elle ne disparaît pas, devient Oligo clonale, restreinte à quelques épitopes, qui peuvent être non liés à la pathogénie Ceci permet d’expliquer la persistance d’ANCA chez des patients en rémission clinique complète Il n’est donc pas licite de proposer de réintroduire ou de majorer le traitement immunosuppresseur sur la seule base de la réapparition ou la ré-ascension du titre des ANCA Il n’y a pas de consensus sur les règles de l’utilisation des ANCA dans le suivi des patients Néanmoins certaines règles de bonnes pratiques sont à respecter : Le clinicien devra si possible avoir recours au même laboratoire pour garantir l’homogénéité dans le suivi des résultats Seule une différence de titre d’au moins trois dilutions à une valeur significative Alors que pour les tests Elisa la comparaison des résultats à deux dates différentes, ne peut se faire qu’à condition de repasser le sérum antérieur dans la série du jour Interprétation du résultat de l’IFI ne peut se faire qu’avec le résultat de l’identification de la cible (MPO et PR3), et n’a de pertinence que replacée dans le contexte clinique du patient pour qui l’examen a été prescrit ","date":"2023-09-28","objectID":"/basic-markdown-syntax/:6:0","tags":["IMMUNOPATHOLOGIE"],"title":"Les vascularites à ANCA","uri":"/basic-markdown-syntax/"},{"categories":["IMMUNOPATHOLOGIE"],"content":"6 ANCA en urgence Certaines vascularites associées aux ANCA peuvent mettre en jeu le pronostic vital ou fonctionnel, qu’elles se traduisent par une glomérulonéphrite rapidement progressive ou un syndrome pneumorénal Dans un tel contexte, la décision de mettre en route un traitement immunosuppresseur lourd et non dénué d’effets secondaires ne peut attendre la confirmation par l’examen anatomopathologique (rein..)

The basic chart types ECharts supports include line series, bar series, scatter series, pie charts, candle-stick series, boxplot series for statistics, map series, heatmap series, lines series for directional information, graph series for relationships, treemap series, sunburst series, parallel series for multi-dimensional data, funnel series, gauge series. And it’s extremely easy to create a combinition of them with ECharts. Just insert your ECharts option in JSON/YAML/TOML format in the echarts shortcode and that’s it.
